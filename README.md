# Data-Collection
Scripts to pull data from various sources and insert into MySQL Database
All scripts are written to work in Python 3.0, specifically with Anaconda and interact with MySQL.

In order to replicate the full functionality of the Python 2 MySQLdb library, pymysql is used in the scripts.  Sqlalchemy is used in tandem so that pandas can read the database flavor as MySQL.

Additional requirements:
  -Blmbrg API
  -MySQL
